Explanation:

The script starts with the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter.
The target_dir variable is set to the directory where you want to deploy the files. Replace /path/to/deploy with the actual target directory.
The source_dir variable is set to the directory where the files to be deployed are located. Replace /path/to/source with the actual source directory.
The cp command is used to recursively copy (-r) the files from the source directory to the target directory.
The script checks the exit status of the cp command using $? and prints a success or failure message accordingly.
Note: Make sure to replace /path/to/deploy and /path/to/source with the actual paths of your target and source directories.

Remember to make the script executable using the command chmod +x deploy_script.sh before running it.

This script provides a basic example of an automated deployment script. You can modify it according to your specific deployment requirements, 
such as including additional checks, logging, or handling different file types and directories.
