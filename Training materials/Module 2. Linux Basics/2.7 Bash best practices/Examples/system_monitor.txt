Explanation:

The script starts with the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter.
The cpu_usage variable uses the top command to retrieve the CPU usage percentage.
The memory_usage variable uses the free command to calculate the memory usage percentage.
The disk_usage variable uses the df command to retrieve the disk usage percentage of the root filesystem ("/").
The ping command is used to check network connectivity to google.com with a count of 3 pings. The output is redirected to /dev/null to suppress it.
The script checks the exit status of the ping command using $? and prints the network connectivity status accordingly.
Note: You can modify the script to include additional system monitoring checks based on your requirements. 
For example, you can check CPU load averages, disk space usage for specific directories, network interface statistics, or any other system metric of interest.

Remember to make the script executable using the command chmod +x system_monitor.sh before running it.
