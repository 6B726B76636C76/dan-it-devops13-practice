Explanation:

The script starts with the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter.
The input_file variable is set to the path of the input file that contains the data to be processed. Replace /path/to/input_file.csv with the actual path.
The output_file variable is set to the path where the processed data will be saved. Replace /path/to/output_file.txt with the desired output file path.
The awk command is used to process the data from the input file. In this example, it prints the first and third columns of the CSV file, separated by space.
The processed data is redirected (>) to the output file.
The script checks the exit status of the awk command using $? and prints a success or failure message accordingly.
Note: Make sure to replace /path/to/input_file.csv and /path/to/output_file.txt with the actual paths of your input and output files.

Remember to make the script executable using the command chmod +x data_processing_script.sh before running it.

This script provides a basic example of a data processing script using the awk command. 
You can modify it according to your specific data processing requirements, such as changing the data manipulation logic, 
using different field separators, or incorporating additional data transformation steps.
