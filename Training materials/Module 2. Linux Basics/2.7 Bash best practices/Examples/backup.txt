The script starts with the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter.
The source_dir variable is set to the source directory you want to back up.
The backup_dir variable is set to the destination directory where the backup will be stored.
The timestamp variable is generated using the date command to create a unique name for the backup file.
The backup_file variable concatenates the backup_dir, "backup_", and the timestamp to create the backup file path.
The tar command is used to create a compressed archive (tar.gz) of the source directory.
The backup file is saved in the specified backup_dir with the generated timestamp in the file name.
The script checks the exit status of the tar command using $? and prints a success or failure message accordingly.
Note: Make sure to replace /path/to/source and /path/to/backup with the actual paths of your source and backup directories.

Remember to make the script executable using the command chmod +x backup_script.sh before running it.

This script provides a basic example of creating a file backup using the tar command. 
You can modify it according to your specific backup requirements, 
such as including multiple directories, excluding certain files, 
or implementing additional error handling and logging mechanisms.
